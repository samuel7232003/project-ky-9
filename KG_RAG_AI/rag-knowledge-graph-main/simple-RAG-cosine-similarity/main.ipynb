    "# How to Query a Knowledge Graph with LLMs using RAG\n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will build a knowledge graph using a dataset of Amazon toy products. We will populate the knowledge graph with embeddings to enable semantic search capabilities. By the end of this tutorial, you will understand how to create a knowledge graph, add embeddings, and perform semantic searches to find products that match natural language queries.\n",

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge graphs are powerful tools for modeling complex, interconnected data. They allow us to represent entities (nodes) and the relationships (edges) between them in a flexible and semantically rich way. In contrast to traditional relational databases, knowledge graphs explicitly store relationships, making querying more efficient and intuitive for complex data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we'll explore how to build a knowledge graph from a real-world dataset and enhance it with embeddings to perform semantic searches. We'll use Neo4j, a graph database platform, to store and query our graph."
